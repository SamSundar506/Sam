üìù IMPORTANT: Please rename your PDF file

Current filename: "30 Day Challenge.pdf"
New filename needed: "30-Day-Challenge.pdf"

Why the change?
- Spaces in filenames can cause issues on GitHub Pages
- Hyphens are more web-friendly
- This will fix the "file not found" error

Steps:
1. Rename "30 Day Challenge.pdf" to "30-Day-Challenge.pdf"
2. Keep it in this same folder (public/downloads/)
3. Delete this instruction file
4. Run: npm run build
5. Deploy the new dist folder

The download will then work perfectly on GitHub Pages!
